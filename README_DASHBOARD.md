## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**
   - Check if server is running on `http://localhost:4000`
   - Verify JWT token is valid
   - Check browser console for error messages

2. **API Requests Failing**
   - Ensure server is accessible
   - Check authentication token
   - Verify CORS settings on server

3. **Jobs Not Updating**
   - Check WebSocket connection status
   - Try manual refresh
   - Verify job worker is running on server

### Performance
- **Large Job Lists**: Use pagination and filtering to improve performance
- **Memory Usage**: Browser will automatically clean up old notifications
- **Network**: WebSocket provides efficient real-time updates

## Security Considerations

- **JWT Tokens**: Stored securely in localStorage
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Token Expiry**: Automatic token refresh handling
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for better UX

## Customization

- Colors and themes
- Component styles
- Layout and spacing
- Animations and transitions

### Functionality
Extend the dashboard by:
- Adding new job types
- Implementing additional filters
- Creating custom notification types
- Adding more webhook event types

## Development

### Local Development
1. Ensure the backend server is running
2. Open `job-monitor.html` in a browser
3. Use browser developer tools for debugging

### Production Deployment
1. Host the HTML file on a web server
2. Update `API_BASE` constant to point to production server
3. Configure HTTPS for secure connections
4. Set up proper CORS on the backend server

This dashboard provides a complete interface for job monitoring and management with real-time capabilities and a modern, responsive design.
