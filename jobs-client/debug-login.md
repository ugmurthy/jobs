# Login Debug Instructions

Follow these steps to debug the login issue where the JWT token is visible in the response but the frontend indicates login failed:

## Steps to Reproduce and Debug

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
2. Go to the Network tab in dev tools
3. Go to the Console tab in a separate dev tools panel
4. Navigate to the login page
5. Enter valid credentials and submit the login form
6. Observe the network request to `/api/auth/login`
7. Check the console logs we've added

## What to Look For

In the console logs, look for:

1. **Login form submission**: 
   - "Login form submitted with data: ..."

2. **API request details**:
   - "API Request: POST /api/auth/login"
   - "Request headers: ..."
   - "Request body: ..."

3. **API response details**:
   - "Response status: ..."
   - "Response content-type: ..."
   - "Response JSON data: ..." or "Response text data: ..."

4. **Redux state updates**:
   - "Login fulfilled - Updated auth state: ..." (if successful)
   - "Login rejected - Error: ..." (if failed)

5. **Auth Provider state**:
   - "AuthProvider - Auth State: ..."

## Possible Issues to Check

Based on the logs, determine if:

1. The API response contains the expected `token` and `user` properties
2. The token is being properly stored in localStorage
3. The Redux state is being updated correctly
4. The token format is what the application expects
5. There are any errors in the authentication flow

## After Collecting Logs

After you've collected the logs, we can analyze them to determine the exact cause of the login failure and implement a fix.
