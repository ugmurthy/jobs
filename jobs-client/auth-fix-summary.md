# Authentication and Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Problem 1: Authentication Error

### Problem Identified
When logging in, the browser redirects to `/dashboard` but encounters a 404 error when trying to fetch user data from `/auth/me`. The network tab in dev tools shows a response to `/auth/me` as:

```
{"message":"Not Found - /auth/me","code":"error"}
```

### Root Cause
After examining the codebase, I found that:

1. The frontend's `authSlice.ts` makes a request to `/auth/me` in the `fetchCurrentUser` function
2. The API utility prepends `/api` to all endpoints, so the actual request is to `/api/auth/me`
3. The backend routes in `src/routes/auth.ts` did not include a `/me` endpoint
4. The backend had a `/auth/protected` endpoint that returns user information, but it wasn't being used by the frontend

### Solution Implemented
I added the missing `/auth/me` endpoint to the backend in `src/routes/auth.ts`:

```javascript
/**
 * Get current user information
 */
router.get('/me', authenticate, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    if (!req.user) {
      res.status(401).json({ message: 'Not authenticated' });
      return;
    }
    
    // Get full user details from database
    const user = await userService.getUserById(req.user.userId);
    
    if (!user) {
      res.status(404).json({ message: 'User not found' });
      return;
    }
    
    // Return user without sensitive information
    res.json({
      id: user.id,
      username: user.username,
      email: user.email,
      createdAt: user.createdAt,
      updatedAt: user.updatedAt
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error fetching current user:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'An error occurred while fetching user data' });
  }
});
```

## Problem 2: Blank Dashboard

### Problem Identified
After fixing the authentication issue, the dashboard page was blank with console errors showing:

```
Uncaught Error: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.
```

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by an infinite update loop in the WebSocketProvider component:

1. There were two different implementations for WebSocket handling:
   - The `WebSocketProvider.tsx` component that creates a WebSocket connection and dispatches Redux actions
   - The `socket.ts` utility that also creates a WebSocket connection and dispatches Redux actions

2. When the user logged in, the WebSocketProvider would:
   - Try to establish a connection and dispatch the `connecting()` action
   - This would update the Redux state, causing a re-render
   - The component would run its effect again, creating another connection
   - This cycle would repeat, causing the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error

### Solution Implemented
I simplified the WebSocketProvider to use the existing socket.ts utility instead of duplicating the WebSocket connection logic:

```javascript
import { ReactNode, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useAppSelector } from '@/app/hooks';
import { initializeSocket, closeSocket } from '@/lib/socket';

interface WebSocketProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function WebSocketProvider({ children }: WebSocketProviderProps) {
  const { isAuthenticated, token, apiKey } = useAppSelector((state) => state.auth);
  
  // Initialize socket connection when authenticated
  useEffect(() => {
    // Only initialize if we have authentication
    if (isAuthenticated && (token || apiKey)) {
      console.log('WebSocketProvider - Initializing socket connection');
      initializeSocket();
      
      // Cleanup on unmount
      return () => {
        console.log('WebSocketProvider - Closing socket connection');
        closeSocket();
      };
    }
  }, [isAuthenticated, token, apiKey]);

  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

## Testing the Fixes

To test the fixes:

1. Restart the backend server to apply the authentication endpoint changes
2. Restart the frontend application to apply the WebSocketProvider changes
3. Try logging in again
4. The browser should successfully redirect to `/dashboard` and display the dashboard content without errors

## Alternative Solutions Considered

For the authentication issue:
1. Modify the frontend to use the existing `/auth/protected` endpoint instead of `/auth/me`
2. Create a proxy or redirect in the backend to map `/auth/me` to `/auth/protected`

For the WebSocket issue:
1. Modify the WebSocketProvider to better handle state updates and prevent infinite loops
2. Remove the WebSocketProvider entirely and initialize the socket connection directly in the app

I chose the implemented solutions as they were the most straightforward and maintained the existing architecture while fixing the issues.
