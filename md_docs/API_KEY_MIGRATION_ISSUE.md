# API Key Migration Issue Fixed

I've successfully resolved the Prisma migration error that was occurring when running `node scripts/apply-api-key-migrations.js`. Here's what was done:

## Root Cause
The error occurred because SQLite (your database provider) doesn't support arrays of primitive types like `String[]`. The `permissions` field in the `ApiKey` model was defined as a string array, which is incompatible with SQLite.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Modified the Prisma schema**:
   - Changed `permissions String[]` to `permissions String` in the schema
   - The field now stores a JSON string representation of the array

2. **Updated the API Key Service**:
   - Added JSON serialization/deserialization for the permissions field
   - When storing: `JSON.stringify(permissions)`
   - When retrieving: `JSON.parse(apiKey.permissions as string) as string[]`

3. **Fixed TypeScript type issues**:
   - Created an `AuthenticatedUser` interface that extends `UserPayload`
   - Updated the Express request type definitions
   - Used type assertions in the auth middleware

4. **Applied the migration**:
   - Successfully generated and applied the Prisma migration
   - Regenerated the Prisma client

The API key functionality now works correctly with SQLite while maintaining the array functionality in your application code. The permissions are stored as a JSON string in the database but are handled as arrays in your TypeScript code.

You can now use API key authentication alongside JWT authentication as intended.
