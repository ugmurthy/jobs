JobRunner is a powerful, modular, and extensible system for job queue management, designed for reliability, scalability, and an excellent developer experience. It includes a robust backend service, a dynamic job handler system, and a modern web-based client for managing jobs and schedules.

## Backend Service

The JobRunner backend is a Node.js/TypeScript service for handling asynchronous job processing. It offers a comprehensive API for job submission, monitoring, and management, with real-time updates via WebSockets and a visual dashboard for queue monitoring.

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for improved maintainability.
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive endpoints for job, webhook, and API key management.
- **Dual Authentication**: Secure access with both JWT and API Key authentication.
- **Reliable Job Processing**: Utilizes BullMQ for robust job queue management.
- **Flexible Job Scheduling**: Supports cron expressions and repeat intervals.
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for instant updates on job progress.
- **Visual Dashboard**: Integrated Bull Board UI for at-a-glance queue monitoring.
- **Type Safety**: Fully implemented in TypeScript for a more stable codebase.
- **Job Flows**: Define and manage complex, multi-step job workflows.

## Job Handler System

The job handler system provides a modular and extensible way to process tasks. It dynamically discovers and loads job handlers at runtime, supports hot reloading for seamless updates, and can be extended with a powerful plugin system.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Handler Registration**: Handlers are automatically discovered and loaded.
- **Hot Reloading**: Update job handlers without restarting the worker.
- **Extensible with Plugins**: Add new functionality through npm packages.
- **Multi-Queue Support**: Process jobs from multiple queues with different configurations.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Easily enable, disable, and configure handlers.

## Jobs Client (Frontend)

The Jobs Client is a modern, responsive web interface for interacting with the JobRunner backend. It provides a user-friendly way to manage jobs, view scheduled tasks, and monitor the system.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Job Management**: Browse, view details, and submit jobs with ease.
- **Real-time Status Monitoring**: Live updates on job status.
- **Advanced Scheduler**: Manage scheduled jobs with support for cron expressions, intervals, and one-time execution.
- **Secure Authentication**: Supports both user login and API key authentication.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Includes a responsive design, dark/light modes, and toast notifications.
