# Modularization Plan for src/index.ts

After reviewing the `src/index.ts` file, I can see it's quite large (950+ lines) and handles multiple responsibilities. Modularizing this file would improve maintainability, readability, and make it easier to extend the application in the future.

Here's a comprehensive plan to modularize the codebase by grouping related functionality:

## Proposed Directory Structure

```
src/
├── config/
│   ├── app.ts         # Express app setup, middleware, etc.
│   ├── socket.ts      # Socket.IO configuration
│   ├── bull.ts        # Bull/BullMQ configuration
│   ├── redis.ts       # Redis configuration
│   └── env.ts         # Environment variables
│
├── middleware/
│   ├── auth.ts        # Authentication middleware
│   └── error.ts       # Error handling middleware
│
├── routes/
│   ├── index.ts       # Route registration
│   ├── auth.ts        # Authentication routes
│   ├── jobs.ts        # Job management routes
│   ├── webhooks.ts    # Webhook management routes
│   └── admin.ts       # Admin routes
│
├── services/
│   ├── userService.ts # (already exists)
│   ├── jobService.ts  # Job-related business logic
│   └── webhookService.ts # Webhook-related business logic
│
├── workers/
│   ├── index.ts       # Worker registration
│   └── webhookWorker.ts # Webhook processing worker
│
├── events/
│   ├── index.ts       # Event registration
│   ├── jobEvents.ts   # Job event handlers
│   └── socketEvents.ts # Socket event handlers
│
├── utils/
│   ├── validation.ts  # Input validation helpers
│   └── logger.ts      # Logging utilities
│
└── index.ts           # Application entry point (much smaller)
```

## Functional Groupings

1. **Server & Configuration** (config/*)
   - Express app setup
   - Socket.IO configuration
   - Bull/BullMQ setup
   - Redis connection
   - Environment variables

2. **Authentication** (middleware/auth.ts, routes/auth.ts)
   - Authentication middleware
   - Login/logout routes
   - Token management
   - Password reset functionality

3. **Job Management** (routes/jobs.ts, services/jobService.ts)
   - Job submission
   - Job status retrieval
   - Job listing and filtering

4. **Webhook Management** (routes/webhooks.ts, services/webhookService.ts)
   - CRUD operations for webhooks
   - Webhook processing logic

5. **Event Handling** (events/*)
   - Queue event listeners (progress, completed, failed, delta)
   - Socket.IO event handling

6. **Worker Implementation** (workers/*)
   - Webhook worker
   - Job processing

This modularization approach provides several benefits:
- Improved code organization and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced maintainability
- Easier testing
- Simplified onboarding for new developers
- More scalable architecture for future development

The implementation can be done incrementally, starting with the most independent modules (like configuration and utilities) and gradually refactoring the more complex parts of the application.
