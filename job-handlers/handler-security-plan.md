# Handler Security Plan

## Current Understanding

Based on examining the codebase, particularly the `ollama.js` handler, I've identified how the system currently handles user identification and result routing:

1. Jobs include a `userId` field in their data
2. Handlers use this userId when sending results back via the webHookQueue
3. For streaming responses, the userId is included in progress updates

## Security Considerations for the `getHandlers` Handler

The newly created `getHandlers` handler should incorporate the following security measures:

### 1. User Authentication

- Verify that the job includes a valid `userId`
- Reject requests without proper user identification
- Consider implementing role-based access control for sensitive handler information

### 2. Information Filtering

- Consider whether all users should have access to all handler information
- Potentially filter handlers based on user permissions
- Exclude sensitive information from handler details (e.g., internal implementation details)

### 3. Result Routing

- Ensure results are only sent back to the authenticated user
- Include the userId in the response for verification on the client side
- Use the webHookQueue pattern established in other handlers

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the `getHandlers.js` file to:
   - Extract and validate the userId from the job data
   - Filter handlers based on user permissions if applicable
   - Include the userId in the response
   - Use the webHookQueue for result routing if appropriate

2. Consider implementing a more comprehensive security framework:
   - User authentication middleware
   - Permission-based handler access
   - Audit logging for handler access

3. Document security best practices for handler developers:
   - Always verify userId before processing jobs
   - Include userId in all responses
   - Implement proper error handling for security failures

## General Handler System Security Improvements

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement a robust authentication system for job submission
   - Validate user credentials before accepting jobs
   - Use secure tokens or session IDs for user identification

2. **Job Validation**:
   - Validate that jobs contain required security fields (userId)
   - Implement schema validation for job data
   - Reject malformed or suspicious job requests

3. **Result Routing**:
   - Ensure all handlers follow a consistent pattern for routing results
   - Use a dedicated queue or channel for each user
   - Implement encryption for sensitive results

4. **Access Control**:
   - Define permission levels for different handlers
   - Restrict access to sensitive handlers based on user roles
   - Implement a configuration system for handler permissions

5. **Audit Logging**:
   - Log all handler access attempts
   - Track successful and failed job executions
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns or potential security breaches
